#### Menu

To set up your menu you need to have a file called `DIGEST.md` in the root of your repo. If you created your docs with an empty GitHub repo we would have already created this file for you.

 See an example `DIGEST.md` below. I would suggest your first item be the Overview like below. See the next section about the `README.md` file. 

```markdown
* [Overview](README.md)

## Prologue

* [Introduction and Installaton](prologue/introduction-and-installaton.md)
* [Contributing Guide](prologue/contributing-guide.md)
* [How To Contribute](prologue/how-to-contribute.md)
* [Release Cycle](prologue/release-cycle.md)

## External Links

* [Github](https://github.com)
```

Anything in `DIGEST.md` will be displayed in the menu. Make sure your links are correct.
